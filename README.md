# 🌐 Webpage Project

This project was created as part of a web development course.  
It’s based on a ready-made design, but I made my own changes, such as:

- 🎨 Updating the colors and images  
- ✨ Adding animations and small movements  
- 🖊️ Writing parts of the code myself  
- 🧩 Understanding how the whole webpage works

## 🛠️ What I Learned
- 📄 Structuring a webpage with **HTML**  
- 🎨 Styling with **CSS**  
- 🖌️ Making small design improvements  
- 🔍 Reading and understanding existing code

## 📌 Note
This project is mainly for **learning purposes**, but I’m proud of the progress I made and the customizations I added.
